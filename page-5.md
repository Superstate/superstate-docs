# SUP Token

SUP will be the token responsible for governance as well as fee distribution. The holders will be responsible for treasury management, inflation mechanisms, high level decisions, protocol approvals and more as needed

## **Distribution**

**1,000,000,000 Total Supply**

200,000,000 Team allocation

100,000,000 LP rewards&#x20;

200,000,000 SUP LP Bootstrap for Treasury&#x20;

200,000,000 LP Swap USDc/DAI for Treasury&#x20;

300,000,000 DAO Treasury

LP rewards will be given during and post vampire attack as a risk free way to acquire SUP without needing to directly swap assets. We believe that the best way to align the responsibility for treasury managements by having the voters having controlled and supplied the assets, effectively managing their own money. Rewards that do not have a direct commitment such as LP rewards will earn tSUP a token which can be locked and exchanged for SUP increasing with time, and burning the difference between total possible withdraw and 0 relative to tme staked. This prevents sellers all rushing to sell right after they get tokens.

Vests for team will be a 1y vest.

## LP Bootstrap
200,000,000 SUP will be swappable for LP tokens from the USDc / DAI AMM at 1 SUP to $1 in LP tokens which will then be owned by the Treasury. This allows the SUP holders to directly have a say about how their money gets used and creates a cost basis and collateralzed floor through the tokens being able to liquidate the DAO for the Treasury assets to be split among holders. We believe that by rather than give away tokens and making rewards just be sold, creating a way for those that want to acquire votings rights to directly have a stake for malicious proposals and help with voter apathy to make the DAO actually decentralized in decision making. The LP tokens will also create a revene stream for operations.

200,000,000 SUP will also be allocated to the SUP / USDc AMM to create a liquid market so that the Treasury has optionalty using SUP and revenues and allowing allocations to not risk malicious actors purchasing large stake during drops with low liquidity to absorb large allocations.

## zSUP
zSUP will be paid out for temporary LP rewards to attract LP from other protocols and establish AMMs without investment needed. The stake rewards will be zSUP which then can be locked by the user to earn SUP, but should the zSUP be staked for say 2w with a 4w maturity, the user only gets .5x the SUP and the rest will be burned / returned to Treasury. This allows tokens to be rewarded, users never to be locked and stop large scale sudden sell pressure as rewards would just be sold when earned. This rewards those who are committed to the protocol more than those just there for free money. And since the tokens are all free, there needs to be incentives to reward commitment, but allow to sell.
