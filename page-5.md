# SUP Token

SUP will be the token responsible for governance as well as fee distribution. The holders will be responsible for treasury management, inflation mechanisms, high level decisions, protocol approvals and more as needed

**Updating Deposit Protocols**

A MultiSignature address will be used to allow for the protocols targeted for deposits for the AMM to be updated to maximize yield and APY, while only choosing large, reputable battle tested protocols. The team may also have the AMM withdraw from the protocol and not deposit should there be concerns about security and no alternatives found. Projects can also create their own AMM contract for their tokens, allowing users to benefit from APY on stables/eth/tokens while LPs. Finally we will allow for developers to create an AMM contract that uses any custom protocol for deposits, though these will not be shown in the front end unless checked.

## **Distribution**

**1,000,000,000 Total Supply**

200,000,000 Team allocation

100,000,000 LP rewards&#x20;

200,000,000 SUP LP Bootstrap for Treasury&#x20;

200,000,000 LP Swap USDc/DAI for Treasury&#x20;

300,000,000 DAO Treasury

LP rewards will be given during and post vampire attack as a risk free way to acquire SUP without needing to directly swap assets. We believe that the best way to align the responsibility for treasury managements by having the voters having controlled and supplied the assets, effectively managing their own money. Rewards that do not have a direct commitment such as LP rewards will earn tSUP a token which can be locked and exchanged for SUP increasing with time, and burning the difference between total possible withdraw and 0 relative to tme staked. This prevents sellers all rushing to sell right after they get tokens.

Vests for team will be a 1y vest.
