# Vampire Attack

## The Suckening
### We Suck (Liquidity)
We allow people to easily help us get liquidity without affecting revenues until we are ready to go live. Stakers can deposit their Uniswap and Sushiswap LP tokens directly as well as other Swap tokens, allowing us to perform whats known as a vampire attack, where we are able to withdraw LP from those protocols all at the same time to our AMM, creating an instant liquid market, with no management for LPs beyond just the deposit. This lets LPs easily turn their LPs into productive LP right from the start without losing revenue while waiting!
